# CARLA Object Detection and Classification with YOLOv8

This project integrates the cutting-edge YOLOv8 object detection model with the CARLA autonomous driving simulation environment to create a robust object detection and classification system. Utilizing a custom dataset prepared and annotated with RoboFlow, this solution aims to enhance autonomous driving technologies by accurately identifying and classifying various objects in real-time within the simulation.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Leverages YOLOv8 for high-speed, accurate object detection within the CARLA simulation environment.
- **Custom Dataset**: Utilizes a meticulously prepared dataset, annotated and optimized with RoboFlow, tailored for the autonomous driving context.
- **Seamless Integration**: Efficiently integrates with CARLA, providing a streamlined workflow for simulation-based object detection and classification.
- **Extensive Object Classification**: Capable of identifying a wide range of objects crucial for autonomous driving, including vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
